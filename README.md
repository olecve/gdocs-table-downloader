# üìÑ‚û°üìÅ gdocs-table-downloader (_GTD_)

Download your translations from Google Spreadsheet. Very popular library to support a workflow
when you store your translations in Google Spreadsheets. <abbr title="gdocs-table-downloader">GTD</abbr>
downloads translations for you, considering **your** files structure.

In other words, having a [spreadsheet](/docs/spreadsheet-window.png) like this:

![Source table](/docs/spreadsheet-window-thumb.png)

You can get the [result file](/docs/result-file-esm-example.png) like this:

![Result file](/docs/result-file-esm-example.png)

Please, take a look at the [example Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oFig-VwfFKP3BLsW4ZgLiw5ftAfcD4jpcUwmXBdhCPU)
file. [GTD CI (Github Actions)](https://github.com/theghostbel/gdocs-table-downloader/actions) use this file not only
to ensure that the unit tests are passing, but also to ensure that integration with Google Sheets API is in a shape.

## üÜò How to use?

1. Install the package
```
npm i gdocs-table-downloader -g
```
2. Set your Google Secrets to `options.js` (see `customOptions.default.js` for example)
3. Run it
```
gdocs-table-downloader --token XXX --sheets one,two --customOptions ./options.js --moduleType ESM --target ./out/{sheet}.{locale}.js
```

If your Google Spreadsheet had sheets `one` and `two`, each having, for example,
`en` and `de` locales, you should get next file structure:
```
folder-where-you-ran-this-script/
‚îî‚îÄ out/
   ‚îú‚îÄ one.de.js
   ‚îú‚îÄ one.en.js
   ‚îú‚îÄ two.de.js
   ‚îî‚îÄ two.en.js
```

# ‚öôÔ∏è Options

See `options.js`, it's `yargs` config. Also, if you run this script and
forgetting to mention some required options, you would get a description of
what you've missed.

## üì¶ What is `moduleType`?

Currently, `gdocs-table-downloader` supports two types of modules in generated files: AMD and ESM.
You can observe examples in `test/expected`.

### AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)

```js
/* eslint quotes: 0 */
define({
  "row1": "cellValue"
})
```

### ESM (ECMAScript module)

```js
/* eslint quotes: 0 */
export default {
  "row1": "cellValue"
}
```

## üôä What about secrets?

Google Sheets API requires any kind of authentication since v4.
`gdocs-table-downloader` is limited to the "service account" type.
You should create such account in Google Console and then you have two options:

1. Put `private_key` and `client_email` directly to a file specified by `--customOptions` param. See `customOptions.default.js` for example.
2. Put `private_key` and `client_email` to ENV and read them from `process.env`

Frankly, you're not restricted to only these two methods. You can invent any
type of "secrets storing", just ensure that `getGoogleAuthCredentials()` returns
an object with two properties: `private_key` and `client_email`.

## üõÉ Custom value mappings

If you need to perform some custom mapping to values in cells before they are downloaded,
you can specify `getValueMapper(rawCellValue)` function in `--customOptions` file.

Every cell value goes through this function and the return value is stored to a result file.

If you don't specify `getValueMapper`, the default function from `customOptions.default.js`
would be used: it changes "undefined" values to empty strings.
